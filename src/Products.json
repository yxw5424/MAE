In this way, the liquid volume of oil-water separation is increased from about 50% to more than 95%.The swirl separation devicenot only improves the effective volume of the equipment, but also plays a certain role inbalancing the pressure of the equipment, stabilizing the flow state, defoaming and absorbingenergy.This technology is very effective for oil and gas separation of high oil and gas ratiocrude oil and easily foaming crude oil.",
